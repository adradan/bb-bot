This includes an obligation to arbitrate certain claims through binding and final arbitration, unless you opt out of the arbitration when you sign up with us.

Changes take effect when we post them on our Sites. You should view these Terms often to stay informed of any changes that may affect you. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SITE AND/OR SERVICES AFTER WE CHANGE THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGES.

We reserve the right to terminate these Terms, or to refuse, restrict, or discontinue access to or use of the Services (or any portions, components, or features thereof) to you or any other person or entity, if you are in breach of the Terms or for any reason or for no reason whatsoever, at any time, without notice or liability.\n          <br>\n          <br>\n          <h6 class="font-weight-bold">\n            2. About BotBroker Live Marketplace.\n          </h6>\n          BotBroker provides a live marketplace for buyers and sellers of electronic consumer programs known as Bots. A description of the live marketplace process and the rules applicable to buyers and sellers is available on our FAQ page, as updated from time to time. Although the Services include buy and sell functionality: (1) BotBroker facilitates the purchase transaction, but the actual purchase contract is directly between the buyer and seller; (2) although BotBroker might provide historical pricing data, we do not set prices for the items; and (3) BotBroker is not an auctioneer. BotBroker acts as a commercial agent to conclude the sale on behalf of each buyer and seller involved in each transaction. Because sellers set prices, they may be higher than retail value. Any item valuations displayed through the Services are estimates only. BotBroker does not guarantee that any item will sell. We reserve the right to investigate complaints and violations of these Terms and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, may take any actions we deem appropriate, including suspending your account and charging your credit card for costs we incur as a result of the violation. Although the Services are anonymous and we generally do not share your information with other buyers and sellers, we may share your information with law enforcement and other third parties as part of an investigation related to any alleged violation of law or these Terms, and we may respond to all inquiries initiated by law enforcement or other governmental agencies.\n          <br>\n          The Services are accessible to certain international sellers and buyers. BotBroker may provide access to certain features and tools to international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and integrated international shipping, customs and tax tools. Sellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international sale and purchase.\n          <br>\n          <br>\n          <h6 class="font-weight-bold">\n            3. Accounts, Passwords, and Security.\n          </h6>\n          To view or browse the live marketplace, you must create an account using an email address and password or other account creation tools offered on the Services, such as a social media account. To offer items for sale (\xe2\x80\x9cAsk\xe2\x80\x9d) or offer to purchase items (\xe2\x80\x9cBid\xe2\x80\x9d), you must create an account and have a valid credit card or other approved payment method on file with us. You agree that we may charge your credit card or other payment method for amounts you owe as described in these terms, as well as any costs or losses arising from your violation of the Terms. When you register to create an account with us, you agree to provide accurate information about yourself and must not register under a false name or age or use an unauthorized payment method. If you use any Service, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You agree to notify BotBroker immediately upon learning of any unauthorized use of your account or password, or any other unauthorized access or breach of security. However, you may be held liable for losses incurred by BotBroker or any other person or entity due to another person using your account or password. You may not use any other user\xe2\x80\x99s account or password at any time without the express permission and consent of the holder of that account or password. You may not transfer or assign your account.\n          Please review our other policies posted on this site which are part of the Terms and govern your use of the Services. We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, and the Terms at any time. BotBroker cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with these obligations. If you are under 18, you may use the Services only with involvement of a parent or guardian.\n          We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account in the event that you breach any of these Terms.\n          <br>\n          <br>\n          <h6 class="font-weight-bold">\n            4. Fees, Promotional/Discount Codes and Taxes.\n          </h6>\n          Fees for the Services, including applicable shipping fees, are described in our FAQ , as updated from time to time. BotBroker may sometimes furnish an alphanumeric code that can be used for promotions or discounts for purchases on our sites. These promotional or discount codes may be sent via email to our registered users, presented on our web sites or circulated at events and through other means and, unless otherwise provided are subject to the promotional or discount terms during the stated advertisement. As a seller you are responsible and agree to collect, pay, report and remit any and all local, state, provincial, federal, or international taxes (including VAT and sales tax) that may be due with respect to your sales transaction, and as a buyer you agree to pay any and all local, state, federal, or international taxes (including sales taxes) that may be due with respect to your purchase transaction. You agree that BotBroker, as the facilitator of the transaction, is not responsible for reporting, collection or payment of any taxes on your behalf. In accordance with the Privacy Policy and if necessary to complete a transaction, you agree to provide BotBroker with your Social Security Number, Social Insurance Number or other tax ID if necessary for BotBroker to provide information to the Internal Revenue Service, Canada Revenue Agency or any provincial tax authority related to payments you receive from us and further authorize BotBroker to release that information to the IRS, CRA, provincial tax authority or other competent governmental body.\n          <br>\n          <br>\n          <h6 class="font-weight-bold">\n            5. Authentication; Transferring between seller and buyer.\n          </h6>\n          As part of the purchase transaction, the seller will provide the license key for said Bot to BotBroker and BotBroker will verify that the license key is authentic. If said Bot includes access to support via Discord or other forms of chat support, this will also be provided as stated in the listing. If BotBroker determines the license key is authentic, BotBroker will transfer the license key to the buyer. Additionally, BotBroker has the right to reject any license key transaction for any reason, not limited to fraudulent keys, or other issues with said Bot. BotBroker\xe2\x80\x99s policy requires sellers to follow the instructions as stated in the HELP page of the website for instructions on how to begin selling on BotBroker.io Because of the nature of this service, once a license key is transferred, there is absolutely no refunds or exchanges for the license key. We will still work with the buyer if license key has any issues activating said Bot.\n          <br>\n          <br>\n          <h6 class="font-weight-bold">\n            6. Seller Obligations.\n          </h6>\n          By listing an item for sale (each posting, a \xe2\x80\x9cNew Ask\xe2\x80\x9d), you are making a binding offer to sell that specific item to a buyer who purchases the item for the Ask price. When a buyer accepts your offer by purchasing your item through our Services, you are contractually and legally bound to proceed with the transaction immediately for the specified price. You are obligated to monitor your inventory and ensure all listings are accurate. Once a Bid and Ask are matched, under no circumstances may a seller cancel the listing.\n          <br>\n          <br>\n          <h6 class="font-weight-bold">\n            7. Buyer Obligations.\n          </h6>\n          As a buyer, you are obligated to pay for any items you Bid on when your Bid matches a seller\xe2\x80\x99s Ask. WHEN YOU PLACE A BID, YOU ARE COMMITTING TO PURCHASE THE ITEM AS SOON AS YOUR BID MATCHES A SELLER\xe2\x80\x99S ASK PRICE AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PAYMENT OF THE ASK PRICE WILL BE\n          <br>\n          TAKEN FROM YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. To be an eligible buyer you must have a billing address and shipping address within one of the countries that BotBroker supports. In general, we charge your credit card immediately upon purchase and hold the funds in escrow until the transaction is complete, at which time we pay the seller. You will not receive any interest on the escrowed amount. If your payment fails or is rejected for any reason (e.g., purchase exceeds credit card limit, card is cancelled, chargeback is requested), BotBroker reserves the right to do any or all of the following, in its sole discretion: (i) charge buyer\xe2\x80\x99s credit card an additional amount equal to 15% of the transaction amount or $15.00 USD for items below $50.00 USD, whichever is greater, as a service fee; (ii) remove any or all of buyer\xe2\x80\x99s Bids from the Services; (iii) cancel any or all of buyer\xe2\x80\x99s orders pending through the Services; (iv) withhold refunds or payments due to buyer; (v) place limits on buyer\xe2\x80\x99s buying and selling privileges; (vi) charge buyer\xe2\x80\x99s credit card for costs, expenses and fees incurred by BotBroker as a result of buyer\xe2\x80\x99s action or inaction; and (vii) temporarily or permanently suspend buyer\xe2\x80\x99s account. ALL SALES ARE FINAL ONCE THE ITEM IS PURCHASED AND TRANSFERRED OF KEY, AND NO REFUND REQUESTS WILL BE HONORED REGARDLESS OF THE CURRENT VALUE OF THE ITEM. If you experience a problem with your purchase or an item, please contact us at support@BotBroker.io. If there is a problem with the license key you received, you must contact us in writing within 48 hours after receiving the license key with a detailed description of the problem.\n          <br>\n          <br>\n          <h6 class="font-weight-bold">\n            8. Limitations and Restrictions.\n          </h6>\n          BotBroker does not provide any guarantee that your items will sell and will not provide any compensation for items that do not sell through our Services.

Legal notices shall be served on BotBroker\xe2\x80\x99s national registered agent (in the case of BotBroker) or your email address on file with us (in your case). Notice by us to you shall be deemed given twenty-four (24) hours after the email is sent. Alternatively, we may give you legal notice by mail to the physical address you have on file with us. In such case, notice shall be deemed given three (3) days after the date of mailing, regardless of whether any such notice is returned to us. It is your responsibility to keep your contact information updated.\n          <br>\n          You and BotBroker each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and BotBroker relating in any way to or arising out of the Terms or your use of or access to the Services, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matters remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The FAA governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.\n          <br>\n          IN ALL EVENTS, EACH PARTY HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARY AND INTENTIONALLY, WAIVES (TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW) ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY DISPUTE ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE SERVICES. THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT, IF AND TO THE EXTENT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATION DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY CLAIM, THAT CLAIM WILL BE TRIED BEFORE A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.\n          <br>\n          a. PROHIBITION OF CLASS AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND NON-INDIVIDUALIZED RELIEF (THE \xe2\x80\x9cCLASS ACTION WAIVER\xe2\x80\x9d). YOU AND BOTBROKER AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND BOTBROKER AGREE OTHERWISE IN A SEPARATE WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON\xe2\x80\x99S OR PARTY\xe2\x80\x99S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY\xe2\x80\x99S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER BOTBROKER USERS. IF A COURT DECIDES THAT APPLICABLE LAW PRECLUDES ENFORCEMENT OF ANY OF THIS PARAGRAPH\xe2\x80\x99S PROHIBITIONS ON CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS AS TO ANY CLAIM, THEN THAT CLAIM (AND ONLY THAT CLAIM) MUST BE SEVERED FROM THE ARBITRATION AND RESOLVED IN COURT, SUBJECT TO YOUR AND BOTBROKER\xe2\x80\x99S RIGHT TO APPEAL THE COURT\xe2\x80\x99S DECISIONS. ALL OTHER CLAIMS WILL BE ARBITRATED.\n          <br>\n          b. Arbitration Procedures. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should also apply the Terms as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the interpretation or enforceability of the CLASS ACTION WAIVER will be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction. Other than issues related to the CLASS ACTION WAIVER, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, any part of it, or of the Terms including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate or the Terms is void or voidable.\n          The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\xe2\x80\x9cAAA\xe2\x80\x9d) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA\xe2\x80\x99s Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA\xe2\x80\x99s Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations will not apply. The AAA\xe2\x80\x99s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The use of the word \xe2\x80\x9carbitrator\xe2\x80\x9d in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration; rather, the AAA\xe2\x80\x99s rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under the Agreement to Arbitrate.\n          A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a completed form Notice of Dispute (\xe2\x80\x9cNotice\xe2\x80\x9d). A Notice to BotBroker should be sent to 1046 Woodward Ave., Detroit, MI 48226. BotBroker will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your BotBroker account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. All information called for in the Notice must be provided, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.\n          If you and BotBroker are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, you or BotBroker may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA\xe2\x80\x99s website at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to BotBroker at the following address: 1046 Woodward Ave., Detroit, MI 48226. In the event BotBroker initiates arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your BotBroker account. Any settlement offer made by you or BotBroker shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.\n          The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or BotBroker may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and BotBroker subject to the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or BotBroker may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.\n          The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.
